Elara is a curious 17-year-old villager with tangled auburn hair and freckled cheeks. Her wide green eyes shine with wonder and determination. Despite her quiet demeanor, sheâ€™s fearless when exploring the unknown. She discovered a mysterious map buried under the roots of an old oak tree near the Whispering Woods.



Shadow is a sleek, silver-furred wolf with piercing blue eyes and a silent, watchful presence. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he moves like a whisper through the trees, always one step ahead of danger. Shadow is both guardian and guide, drawn to the magic of the woods just as Elara is.
