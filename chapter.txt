Elara traced the lines of the map with trembling fingers. Strange symbols marked hidden trails and forgotten clearings deep within the Whispering Woods. In the corner, drawn in faded ink, was a crescent moon above a tree stump — the very stump where she had found the map. Her heart pounded as she realized: this was no child's drawing. It was a guide. A secret path known to someone long ago, maybe even meant for her.

That evening, while the village lanterns flickered to life, Elara packed a small satchel with bread, water, and her grandfather’s old compass. She slipped through the back gate, careful not to wake her family. The woods loomed like a shadowy sea before her, whispering in a tongue only the brave could understand. With one last glance behind her, Elara stepped onto the hidden path, the map clutched tight in her hand.
